## SolidJS template
Don't waste time when building a new Solid app. This template includes:

- Routing (automatic, based on file system)
- Tailwind
- Metatag injection
- SCSS

DX:
- TS config paths
- NextJS inspired project structure
- Auto imports
- Auto format & type check on commit

## Getting started
1. Install the dependencies using `pnpm install`.
2. Generate the imports by starting the dev server using `pnpm dev`.
3. Check `.editorconfig` and `.prettierrc.json` and change them to fit your needs.
3. Enjoy developing a *solid* application!

## Building
1. Run `pnpm prod:build`.
2. (optional) Preview your production build using `pnpm prod:preview`
If you dont want to waste your time just type `pnpm prod`. It will run both commands.
